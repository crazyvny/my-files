                    <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                        Udacity is a for-profit educational organization founded by Sebastian Thrun, David Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky offering massive open online courses (MOOCs).[3]

                        According to Thrun, the origin of the name Udacity comes from the company's desire to be "audacious for you, the student".[4][5] While it originally focused on offering university-style courses, it now focuses more on vocational courses for professionals.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                        Udacity is the outgrowth of free computer science classes offered in 2011 through Stanford University.[6] Thrun has stated he hopes half a million students will enroll, after an enrollment of 160,000 students in the predecessor course at Stanford, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,[7] and 90,000 students had enrolled in the initial two classes as of March 2012.[8][9] Udacity was announced at the 2012 Digital Life Design conference.[10] Udacity is funded by venture capital firm, Charles River Ventures, and $200,000 of Thrun's personal money.

                        In 2014, the Georgia Institute of Technology launched the first "massive online open degree" in computer science by partnering with Udacity and AT&T; a complete master's degree through that program costs students $7,000.

                    <h2>Courses</h2>
                    <p>The first two courses on Udacity started on 20 February 2012,[24] entitled "CS 101: Building a Search Engine", taught by David Evans from the University of Virginia, and "CS 373: Programming a Robotic Car" taught by Thrun. Both courses use Python.

                            Four more courses began on 16 April 2012, encompassing a range of ability and subject matter, with teachers including Steve Huffman and Peter Norvig. Five new courses were announced on 31 May 2012,[25] and marked the first time Udacity offered courses outside the domain of computer science. Four of these courses launched at the start of the third "hexamester", on 25 June 2012. One course, Logic & Discrete Mathematics: Foundations of Computing, was delayed for several weeks before an email announcement was sent out on 14 August stating that the course would not be launched, although no further explanation was provided.
